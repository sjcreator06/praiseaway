Psalm 34

[Verse 1]
I sought the Lord
And He answered me
And delivered me
From every fear

Those who look on Him
Are radiant
They'll never be ashamed
They'll never be ashamed

[Verse 2]
This poor man cried
And the Lord heard me
And saved me from
My enemies

The Son of God
Surrounds His saints
He will deliver them
He will deliver them

[Chorus]
Magnify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name together
Glorify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name forever

[Verse 3]
Oh, taste and see
That the Lord is good
Oh, blessed is He
Who hides in Him

Oh, fear the Lord
Oh, all you saints
He'll give you everything
He'll give you everything

[Chorus]
Magnify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name together
Glorify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name forever

Magnify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name together
Glorify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name forever

[Bridge]
Let us bless the Lord
Every day and night
Never-ending praise
May our incense rise

Let us bless the Lord
Every day and night
Never-ending praise
May our incense rise

Let us bless the Lord
Every day and night
Never-ending praise
May our incense rise

Let us bless the Lord
Every day and night
Never-ending praise
May our incense rise

[Chorus]
(Magnify) Magnify the Lord with me (He's worthy to be praised, exalt His name)
Come exalt His name together (Let's exalt His name, exalt His name today)
Glorify the Lord with me (Glorify His name, we exalt your name Jesus)
Come exalt His name forever (He's worthy, yes He's worthy)

Magnify the Lord with me
Come exalt His name together
(Glorify) Glorify the Lord with me (Come and exalt His name)
Come exalt His name forever (Give Him glory, give Him glory)
