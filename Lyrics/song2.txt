Worthy is the Lamb 

Verse 1
Thank You for the cross Lord
Thank You for the price You paid
Bearing all my sin and shame
In love You came and gave amazing grace

Verse 2
Thank You for this love Lord
Thank You for the nail-pierced hands
Washed me in Your cleansing flow
Now all I know Your forgiveness and embrace

Chorus 1
Worthy is the Lamb seated on the throne
Crown You now with many crowns
You reign victorious

High and lifted up Jesus Son of God
The Treasure of heaven crucified
Worthy is the Lamb
